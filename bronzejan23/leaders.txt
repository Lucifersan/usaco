Each cow i has the following properties:
- Their type is breeds[i]
- Their range is [i, e_arr[i]]

A cow is a potential leader if:
- Their range includes all cows of their own type
- Their range includes any cow of the other type that is a potential leader

Example #1:
4
GHHG
2 4 3 4

- Cow #1:
  - Type is 'G'
  - Range is [1, 2] ("GH..")
  - Could be a leader because contains Cow #2, potential 'H' leader
- Cow #2:
  - Type is 'H'
  - Range is [2, 4] (".HHG")
  - Could be a leader because contains all 'H' cows
- Cow #3:
  - Type is 'H'
  - Range is [3, 3] ("..H.")
  - Cannot be leader
- Cow #4:
  - Type is 'G'
  - Range is [4, 4] ("...G")
  - Cannot be leader

There is only 1 valid leader pair (leader of 'G' and leader of 'H' present),
which is Cow #1 with Cow #2

Example #2:
3
GGH
2 3 3

- Cow #1:
  - Type is 'G'
  - Range is [1, 2] ("GG.")
  - Could be a leader because contains all 'G' cows
- Cow #2:
  - Type is 'G'
  - Range is [2, 3] (".GH")
  - Could be a leader because contains Cow #3, potential 'H' leader
- Cow #3:
  - Type is 'H'
  - Range is [3, 3] ("..H")
  - Could be a leader because contains all 'H' cows

There are 2 valid leader pairs (leader of 'G' and leader of 'H' present),
which are Cow #1 with Cow #3, and Cow #2 with Cow #3
